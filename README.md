I love learning new skills that broaden my perspective. Beginner's mind is a very interesting thing indeed. There are so many new aspects to learn it feels great to have it chunked out into courses that I find straight forward. The more I get a hang of it, the more I am capable of seeing how this can be a possible feat.
